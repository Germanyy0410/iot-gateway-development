# IoT Gateway development using Python 


In this laboratory, the focus of the instructions will be on the **Connect** layer, featuring a function called IoT Gateway. The device acting as the Gateway will gather information and send it to the server, as well as receive control commands from the server on the Collect layer. We will implement the Gateway using the Python programming language. The main contents of this tutorial will include:
- Architecture of the 4 components of the IoT-based application
- Creating an account on the Adafruit IO Server
- Creating a data storage channel on Adafruit IO
